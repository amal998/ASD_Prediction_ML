# Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for ASD Traits Classification in Toddlers

## Project Description

This project aims to perform a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms to classify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) traits in toddlers effectively. ASD is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behaviour, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention and support.

## Objective

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying ASD traits using a provided dataset. By identifying the most effective algorithms, we hope to contribute to the development of more accurate diagnostic tools for early ASD detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study contains various features relevant to ASD traits in toddlers. It includes demographic information, behavioural data, and responses to screening questionnaires. Each instance in the dataset is labelled to indicate whether the toddler exhibits ASD traits.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were evaluated in this study:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
  

## Results

The performance of each algorithm was assessed using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results indicate that XGboost outperforms others in terms of accuracy and robustness in classifying ASD traits.

## Conclusion

This comparative study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms in the context of ASD trait classification. The insights gained from this study can inform the selection of appropriate models for developing reliable ASD diagnostic tools, ultimately aiding in early detection and intervention efforts.
